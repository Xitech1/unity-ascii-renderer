# Unity real-time ASCII renderer
A simple, not super effective, real-time ASCII art renderer (without shaders) for Unity.

### How to use
1. Download the project
2. Open scene: SampleScene
3. Hit play
4. The RenderTextureCamera camera in the scene is the main camera. Moving the camera or objects in front of this camera will affect the ASCII art
5. Optional: You can change the `ASCIICharacters` string in `ASCIIArtGenerator.cs` to anything you like for different densities
