# Unity real-time ASCII renderer
A simple, not super effective, real-time ASCII art renderer (without shaders) for Unity.

1. Download the project
2. Open scene: SampleScene
3. Hit play
4. The RenderTextureCamera camera in the scene is the main camera. Moving the camera or objects in front of this camera will affect the ASCII art
